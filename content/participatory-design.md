## What is participatory design?

Participatory design research involves inviting users, developers, and stakeholders to play an active role during the design process. Participants bring their own views of the problem and may offer ideas or possibilities that were not evident.

## How to conduct a participatory design session:

Give the users a blank canvas to create a site that works for them and provide a list of known elements that will be on the page. Ask the user to prioritize where sections would go on a page, down to the detail of how a widget looks and what it contains. After the exercise is complete, ask the participants to explain why they envisioned the site the way they did. A participatory design session is typically done prior to any design work. Organize a participatory design session when you want to better understand how people think about a given problem.
