## What is a persona?

A persona is a functional representation of a user/user group created from user research. Personas are used to help guide decisions about products, features, navigation, interactions, and visual design. The creation of personas allows the team to stay focused on what is important by recognizing the needs of the user. 

Assumption Based Personas: These are a great way to start. These allow you to begin the process of understanding what you may think the user is wanting, frustrated with, and how what is being built will be used or interacted with.

User Based Personas: These are created from interviewing a series of real people and capturing descriptions about behavior patterns goals, skills, attitudes, and environments that helps identify these users. This is the most accurate type of persona and brings the most value.

First, identify and interview your target users with relevant questions regarding your project. Then, analyze the results from your interviews and start mapping similarities.
