This allows them to construct hypotheses and to better learn why certain elements of their experiences impact user behavior.</p>\n<h2>How to conduct an a/b test:</h2>\n<p>A minimum of 20-25 users/interactions is recommended per iteration. The more the better!</p>\n<p>If you are testing in person, prepare a script and always use the same script to keep the tests consistent. Test with one participant at a time to remove bias from questions and comparisons. ask the participant to think out loud so you will better understand their thought process. ask the participant why they selected a certain version.</p>\n<p>You can also use a platform like <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/">Usability Hub</a> to conduct a/b tests.</p>\n<p>Compare qualitative and quantitative data to determine which version performs better, then use the results to iterate on your product.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"A/B Test",overview:[{heading:"Investment",amount:2,description:"An a/b test intentionally measures only a single change between two otherwise similar items.
