With the multitude of options available for learning about a particular set of users, determining the methods that should be employed to gain that understanding can be challenging.\nTeams are also interested in maximizing the value of their time, and time spent on user research could alternatively be spent on designing or building instead. The following guidelines provide context for some of the most commonly used user research methods employed by design teams and user experience professionals around the world.
